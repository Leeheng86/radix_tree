radix_tree - Naive implementation of Radix Tree for Ruby
Copyright (C) 2012 Hiroshi Nakamura <nahi@ruby-lang.org>

My intention is using Radix Tree instead of Hash for parsing external input
to avoid DoS via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks.


== Performance

* 25 times slower for 10 bytes key, 100000 elements insertion
* 10 times slower for 10 bytes key, 100000 elements retrieval


== TODO

Implement following features for utilizing strength of Radix Tree.
* find predecessor
* find successor
* find_all by start string
* delete_all by start string
